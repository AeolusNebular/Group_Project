Okay I've sorted the navbar, and also disocvered that panels are actually deprecated in bootstrap 5, so I've switched them all to cards (not really very different, but CSS is vastly simplified) - this may have broken the city/network page stylings though (soz)

Add panels instead of divs for user login page to allow for better structuring 
^ not sure what you're getting at here phillip!!
